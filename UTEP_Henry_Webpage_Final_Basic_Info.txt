Folder permissions :
Remember home.html page must be name index.html, always
644: Files with permissions set to 644 are readable by everyone and writeable only by the file/folder owner.
755: Files with permissions set to 755 are readable and executable by everyone, but only writeable by the file/folder owner.
777: Files with permissions set to 777 are readable, writeable, and executable by everyone. Don’t use this set of permissions, for security reasons, on your web server unless absolutely necessary.

Most often, you’re given directions by the plugin or theme developer on which permissions number to assign to the file or folder, and typically, it’s either 644 or 755. Y
