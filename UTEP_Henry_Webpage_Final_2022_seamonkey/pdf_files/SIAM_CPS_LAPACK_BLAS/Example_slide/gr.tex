\subsection{Einstein's field equations}
\begin{frame}{Preliminaries}
\frametitle{What are Einstein's field equations?}
\begin{itemize}
\item General relativity is a theory of gravity.
\item Einstein's equations give a {\it geometric} description.
\item Classical view: motion of any object from A to B is 
due to a gradient in the gravitational field.
\item Einstein's ``new'' view: geometry of space (and time) 
changes continuously from A to B, so an object tends to ``fall''.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Out with the old}
\begin{frame}{Preliminaries}
\frametitle{Why abandon Newtonian concepts 1?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many lines of thought motivated AE, not one single thought or observation.
\item Einstein from his famous 1905 paper: {\it It is known that Maxwell's 
electrodynamics, when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not
appear to be inherent in the phenomena}.  What he meant was that although
the experimental outcomes were consistent, the interpretations were not:
\item According to Maxwell's equations, when conductor stationary/magnet moving:
the changing magnetic field induces a current in the conductor, 
i.e. $\partial \vec{B}/\partial t \neq 0$, and $\nabla \times \vec{E} = 
- \partial \vec(B)/\partial t$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preliminaries}
\frametitle{Why abandon Newtonian concepts 2?}
\begin{itemize}
\item BUT, when magnet stationary/conductor moving, $\vec{B} =  const \rightarrow
\partial \vec{B}/\partial t = 0 \rightarrow \vec{E} = 0$. Nevertheless, there's
still an emf, but now attributed to Lorentz force on the free electrons in
the conductor, $\vec{F} = q \left( \vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B} \right) 
= q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}$.  Thus the force doesn't come from an E-field
and 2 fundamentally different interpretations are needed for the same phenomenon.  
{\color{red} {\bf FAIL!}}
\item Newton's 3 laws are all invariant in inertial reference frames.
Thus {\it mechanical} laws seem absolute (Newton mechanical relativity
principle). Why not extend this to apply to {\it all} physical laws?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Preliminaries}
\frametitle{Why abandon Newtonian concepts 3?}
\begin{itemize}
\item SR was completed in 1905.  $c$ was declared an absolute constant --
inevitable conclusion that Galilean velocity addition was wrong;
kinematics needed a more consistent description.
\item SR showed that co-ordinate measurements depended on the reference
frame of the observer, which appeared to conflict with the generally
accepted view that physical laws should be absolute and also `unified''.
\item Null-result from Michelson--Morley experiment.  There was no 
``aether'' and no ``absolute reference frame''.
\item There was thus no ``absolute space'', contrary to Newton's claim.
\end{itemize}

\begin{beamerboxesrounded}[upper=uppercol,lower=lowercol,shadow=true]
{1. The Relativity Principle}
All intertial reference frames are equivalent for the performance 
of all physical experiments ie. the laws of physics are identical 
in all intertial reference frames.
\end{beamerboxesrounded}

\begin{beamerboxesrounded}[upper=uppercol,lower=lowercol,shadow=true]
{2. Invariance of the speed of light}
In empty space, light travels rectilinearly (i.e. in straight lines) 
at fixed speed c, in every direction in every inertial reference frame,
independent of the state of motion of the emitting body and independent 
of the state of motion of the observer.
\end{beamerboxesrounded}

\subsection{Natural units}
\begin{frame}{Natural units}
The meter and second are arbitrary units introduced for convenience.  
It's simpler to use a more ``natural'' system, so that a suitable 
universal constant becomes a unit.  For GR, we use the speed 
of light, $c$, as a natural unit of speed.\\
\bigskip
Since speed = distance/time, we therefore need to have distance and
time measured in the same units, to have $c$ dimensionless.\\
\bigskip
If this sounds strange, recall we often measure distance 
in ``light years'', i.e. the distance light travels in 1 year.\\
\bigskip
So $c = $(distance light travels per unit time)/(unit time)
and since the top is now measured in $m$, we must have time measured in
$m$ as well, so $c = 1$.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Co-ordinates}
\begin{frame}{Special Relativity}
\frametitle{Co-ordinates notation}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Conventional notation $\mathbf{x}$ $(=t,x,y,x)$ (i.e. $t$ first).
\item Conventional notation $(t,x,y,x)$, i.e. $t$ first.
\item Event -- a single fixed point
in a continuous space.
\item World line -- $x$ as f($t$) for a particle.  
\item Slope of world line $dt/dx = 1/v$.
\item Photons have $45^{\circ}$ world lines --  {\em always}.
\item Alternative representation.  Instead of $(t,x,y,x)$, use
$x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$, where $\alpha$ is any Greek 
index e.g. $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \mu, \nu$.
\item Spatial co-ordinates only can be indicated using Latin indices
e.g. $x^a, x^b, x^i, x^j$ etc.  If no value of the index given, $x^i$ can
be any of the 3 spatial coordinates.

\subsection{Inertial observers and some assumptions}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inertial observers and some assumptions}
SR deals only with non-accelerating (inertial) observers.\\
\bigskip
SR assumes all clocks can be synchronised, and that they
run at the same rate in their rest frames.\\
\bigskip
SR applies only to a spacetime with Euclidean geometry.\\
\bigskip
Note the presence of a gravitational field violates all the above,
so we make the approximation that any field is weak.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Illustrating 2 inertial observers on the same spacetime diagram 1}
Assume 2 observers $\oframe$ and $\obarframe$.  Assume $\obarframe$ moves with
velocity $v$ along $x$ direction relative to $\oframe$ (i.e. assume axes
are aligned -- makes things easier, no loss of generality).\\
$\bar{t}$ is simply  $\obarframe$'s world line, (or, by definition,
the locus of events occurring at $\bar{x}=0$).

In the previous diagram, since the mirror is distance $a$ along
$\bar{x}$, and since light rays must lie at $45^{\circ}$, the time
interval between emission and arrival must be $2a$.\\
\bigskip
Consider this in $\oframe$'s rest-frame.  2nd postulate means light
rays are still at $45^{\circ}$.  Incident and reflected rays must
intersect at mirror, on the $\bar{x}$ axis.

We already saw that, for photons in $\oframe$,\\

The constancy of $c$ thus also requires\\

Consider 2 dimensions initially (simpler).  Since frames are inertial,
assume that $\bar x, \bar y$ are linear combinations
of $x, y$, i.e.\\
$\bar{x} = a_1x + a_2y$\\
$\bar{y} = b_1x + b_2y$\\
For convenience, take $\oframe$ and $\obarframe$ origins coincident at
$t = \bar{t} = 0$.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interval invariance from first principles 2}

The interval measured in $\oframe$ and $\obarframe$ is
%$\overline{\mathbb{O}}$ $\overbar{\mathbb{O}}$ is
\begin{align*}
\bar{s}^2 & = \bar{x}^2 + \bar{y}^2 \\
          & = a_1^2 x^2 + a_2^2 y^2 + 2 a_1 a_2 xy \\
          & + b_1^2 x^2 + b_2^2 y^2 + 2 b_1 b_2 xy
\end{align*}
which can be written as the summation
\begin{align*}
\bar{s}^2 & = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^2 \sum\limits_{\beta=1}^2 
m_{\alpha\beta} x^{\alpha} x^{\beta}
\end{align*}
or, more generally, going to 4-dimensions and reverting to the previous
notation for co-ordinate differences,
\begin{align}
(\Delta \bar{s})^2 & = \sum\limits_{\alpha=0}^3 \sum\limits_{\beta=0}^3 m_{\alpha\beta}
(\Delta x^{\alpha})(\Delta x^{\beta}) \label{dssum}
\end{align}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interval invariance from first principles 3}

Now for photons, for which $(\Delta s)^2 = 0$,
\begin{align*}
(\Delta t)^2 & = (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta z)^2 = (\Delta r)^2 \text { say}
\end{align*}
Substituting this into equation (\ref{dssum}) gives
\begin{align*}
(\Delta \bar{s})^2 & = m_{00} (\Delta r)^2 + 2 \Delta r \sum\limits_{i=1}^3 m_{0i}
  \Delta x^i + \sum\limits_{i=1}^3 \sum\limits_{j=1}^3 m_{ij} \Delta x^i \Delta x^j
\end{align*}
However if $(\Delta s)^2 = 0$, then $(\Delta \bar{s})^2 = 0$ too, which results in
\begin{align*}
m_{0i} & = 0 & \text{ for } i=1,2,3 \\
m_{ij} & = -m_{00} \delta_{ij} & \text{ for } i=1,2,3
\end{align*}
where the Kroneker $\delta_{ij}$ is
\begin{align*}
\delta_{ij} & = 1 & \text{ if } i = j \\
            & = 0 & \text{ if } i \ne j
\end{align*}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interval invariance from first principles 4}

Equation (1) now simplifies to
\begin{align*}
(\Delta \bar{s})^2 & = -m_{00} \left[- (\Delta t)^2 + (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 
+ (\Delta z)^2 \right]
\end{align*}

However $m_{00}$ depends only on the relative velocity $\vec{\bf v}$ 
between $\oframe$ and $\obarframe$.  But the first postulate (Relativity 
Principle) requires that space is isotropic (no preferred direction),  
i.e. $m_{00} = -f(|v|)$, so

Rotate the previous diagram so the $ty$ plane lies in the page.
The $x$ axis thus now points into the page.\\

The $\bar{t}$ axis has to lie in the $tx$ plane.  Thus the $\bar{t}$ axis
must be perpendicular to the $y$ axis.  
(If this seems odd, remember
there is no component of the velocity in the $y$ direction).\\

Since A and B lie on the $y$ axis, the squared interval between 
A and B measured by $\oframe$ equals the square of the length of 
the rod measured by $\oframe$.\\
\bigskip
Since the $y$ and $\bar{y}$ coincide, the same holds for $\obarframe$.\\
\bigskip
Thus, from equation (\ref{fv})\\
\bigskip
\setbeamercolor{lowercol}{fg=black,bg=yellow}
\begin{beamerboxesrounded}[upper=uppercol,lower=lowercol,shadow=true]
{}{(Length of rod in $\oframe$)$^2$ = $f(|v|)$ (Length of 
rod in $\obarframe$)$^2$}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interval invariance from first principles 8. What is $f(|v|)$?}

Now consider 3 frames, $\oframe$, $\obarframe$, and $\dobarframe$.\\
$\obarframe$ moves at +v along $x$ relative to $\oframe$.\\
$\dobarframe$ moves at --v along $x$ relative to $\obarframe$.\\
From equation (\ref{fv}),

\begin{equation*} \left.
\begin{aligned} 
(\Delta \bar{\bar{s}})^2 = f(|v|) (\Delta \bar{s})^2 \\
(\Delta \bar{s})^2 = f(|v|) (\Delta s)^2
\end{aligned} \right\}
\quad \Longrightarrow (\Delta \bar{\bar{s}})^2 = [f(|v|)]^2 (\Delta s)^2
\end{equation*}

However $\obarframe$ and $\dobarframe$ are identical, so 
$(\Delta \bar{\bar{s}})^2 = (\Delta s)^2$ i.e. $f(|v|)^2 = 1$,
and $f(|v|) = 1$ (not $-1$ since square of length of rod must
be positive).  Therefore, finally,
