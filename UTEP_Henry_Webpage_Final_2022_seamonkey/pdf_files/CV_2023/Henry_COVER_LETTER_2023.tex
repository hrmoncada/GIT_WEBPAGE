%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
%I found your UT Austin Scientific Software Architect on UT Austin Jobs and knew I wanted to apply immediately.
My interest in SpaceX stems from my aspirations to develop personally  and  professionally in a fast-paced setting. I thrive in environments that challenge me to think creatively and exceed expectations to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship for myself and my employers.
I believe that my qualifications make me an ideal candidate for the position. I am confident that it would be an extraordinary opportunity for me to grow both professionally and personally, and I would like to be part of your dynamic team.

% PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
Since graduating with a Ph.D. in Computational Science, I have worked for above four years as a parallel computing scientist for Los Alamos Nat. Lab. and Univ. of Texas at El Paso. In this role, I gained substantial experience in software development, coding in C/C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as identifying and fixing bugs. I am valued as a solutions-focused to software development and code optimization, using multiple supporting software tools to identify sections that require change, improve and optimize to performance faster and well scale.   I have experience in all areas covered in your job ad, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Experience in performance, and optimization to improve code efficiency.
\item Strong background in numerical analysis, numerical linear algebra, and numerical ODE and PDE.
\item Experience in mathematical modeling, computational methods for simulations.
\item Experience high performance computing, performance optimization and scalabilty of parallel computer code .
\item Strong background in parallel programming such as MPI, OPENMP, CUDA/HIP, SYCL, OPENACC, and KOKKOS.
\item Experience with optimization and profiling tools such as TotalView, Score-P, MAP, TAU, HPCToolkit. 
\item Fluent in high-level programming languages (C/C++, Fortran, Python, and R).
\item Experience using the following software packages: MATLAB 
\item Experience in software development, designed, developed and building new products using parallel computing.
\item Strong interest in Machine Learning and I am  familiar with PyTorch and TersorFlow.
% \item Proficient using Linux/Unix environment and PETSC, FFTW and METIS/PARMETIS.
% \item Advanced knowledge in mathematical modeling and computational methods for simulations. Besides other projects, I want to point out that I did mathematical modeling of Chagas disease, and development python bioinformatics tools to predict genomic structures and analyze molecular sequences for the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition, I performance evaluation using BLAST and HTCondor job scheduler for workload management and multiple submission jobs.  You can find a brief description in my research statement.
%  \item Flexible to learn new areas of research as needed. 
%  %\item Teaching and mentoring and training people on complex technicals.
\end{itemize}
% PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 
My background includes a Ph.D. degree in Computational Science, MS in Applied Mathematics and BS in Physics. 
I have a full understanding of the lifecycle of a software development project. I also have experience in learning and excelling at new technologies as needed.
Please see my resume for additional information on my experience. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this employment opportunity.

I look forward to your response.
